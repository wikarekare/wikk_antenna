	<li>Cut the 100x50mm (3mm thick) rectangular hollow box section aluminum to 5 waveguide wavelengths, with an additional 100mm added for mounting (About 910mm.  <a href="../8+8Waveguide.html">see double sided waveguide calculator</a> or <a href="../8Waveguide.html">Single sided Waeguide calculator</a>).
 	<li>Mark (with a square and metal scribe) the horizontal center line of each slot and from this, the top and bottom lines of each slot. (<b>Nb.</b> These are all offset 3mm from the top to allow for the insertion of the top reflector.) I used the square to run these lines right around all faces. This ensured the front and rear slots line up.
 	<li>Mark the horizontal center line for the N-Socket hole.
 	<li>Mark a horizontal line at the top of the bottom reflector.
	<li>Mark the vertical center line of each slot. <b>Nb.</b>They alternate left and right of the center. 
	<li>Mark the centers for drilling holes at either end of the slot, 3.25mm in from the top and bottom line.
	<li>Punch each of these marks to help guide the drill.
	<li>Punch the center marks for the N-Socket

	<li>Drill a 10mm hole for the N-Socket, then use a 16mm drill to widen the mouth. The N-Sockets have a conical end. Use an N-Socket to ensure it fits.
	<li>Placing the N-Socket in the hole, mark out the location of the mounting holes.
	<li>Punch the centers of these holes
	<li>I drilled mine to 3mm diameter, so I could thread the holes. I used 4mm nylon bolts, so there is no metal sticking into the cavity.

	<li>Use a router (with a tungsten tipped tool) to join the top and bottom hole of each slot. I only had a 1/4inch cutting tool. This is slightly less than 6.5mm, so I did this in two runs. <b>Nb.</b> Do this slowly so the tool doesn't have to cut too quickly. Also be careful to file away sharp edges at the end of each slot cut.

	<li>The bottom reflector can be riveted in place. It doesn't have to be a perfect fit. Small gaps around the edges will let moisture out. 
	<p><b>Nb.</b>The top pictures are from a single sided version, which is mounted top and bottom. <br>The bottom two are the double sided one. It is mounted on the bottom only, having two brackets for stability.
	<li>
	The top reflector of the Single Sided one was riveted. I used an L shape, the same as the bottom reflector, cutting the mounting side across the diagonal to fit the cut off top (done to stop water buildup). 
	<p>For the Double sided version, the Top Reflector was held in place with small panel pins. I drilled 1mm holes through the front and back of the waveguide and into the edge of the top plate and hammered in the panel pins. 
	<p>I siliconed the edges to ensure the antenna didn't fill up with water. 
	<li>The slots were covered by thin polyester tape (microwave friendly and only a micron thick). This stops water getting in and spiders and other insects making the antenna their home. The tape I used is sometimes called "yellow thermoset tape". Test the tape in a microwave oven. It shouldn't heat up (don't blame me if it melts down, catches fire and sticks to the insdes of the oven).

<ul>
	<li>A conical feed is a much better probe than the straight wire 1/4 wavelength dipole. It is made from a 20mm x 40mm piece of copper and rolled into a cone. It is slightly harder to make, but it is worthwhile.
	<p>
	Cut the red area from the copper and roll into a cone. Solder along the joint and solder onto an N-Connector so that the cones base will be exactly half way across the cavity. In my case, this was 22mm (including the bit of the Nconnector it was soldered to). I had to cut down the center of the Nconnector  slightly.
	<p><b>Nb.</b>The 10mm hole in the waveguide for the Nconnector will be too small for a cone probe. You will need to drill it out to 16mm. Do this in small increments, widening the hole one or two drill bit sizes at a time. It will make a much neater hole.
